Protein as an evolvable functionally constrained amorphous matter
In the movie file, the strong and weak bonds are colored in Red and Cyan in the abstract newtork model of the protein, respectively. 
The dark Blue vectors are the stimuli displacement vectors and the Pink vectors at the top of the network are user-given target displacement. 
The network evolves by exchanging Red bonds with Cyan. 
The final optimized network is the one that has the displacement at target nodes ~equal to the user-given target displacement. 
Different targets exhibit different evolved network.
